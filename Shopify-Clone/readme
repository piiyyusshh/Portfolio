This project is a web application designed to showcase various watches, featuring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It includes a main landing page (`index.html`), a detailed watch display page (`watch.html`), stylesheets (`style.css`, `style1.css`),
and a JavaScript file (`main.js`) for dynamic functionality. The `image` directory contains watch images. 
The application is responsive, interactive, and styled for a modern look. To view the project, open `index.html` in a web browser. 
There are no external dependencies, making it simple to set up and use. Contributions are welcome.
